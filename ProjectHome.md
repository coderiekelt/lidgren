Lidgren.Network is a networking library for .net framework which uses a single udp socket to deliver a simple API for connecting a client to a server, reading and sending messages.
This is the third version of the library.

There are no new download available since google code does not allow file uploads any more; you will (currently) need to download the code via SVN (under Source in the menu)

I'm slowly migrating this project to github, but for a while I'll be maintaining both places. https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3
